Good morning, how is everyone today?\n\nI am back,\n\nkind of exciting I think\nwith exciting developments\n\nand I'm here ready to share it with you.\n\nSo what I would love to hear first\n\njust to make sure that you can all hear me\n\nand see me.\n\nCould you just say hi,\nmaybe tell me where you\n\nare this morning watching,\n\nI would love that.\n\nSo listen,(laughs) a lot of what we do\n\nin the Inner Circle and what we talk about\n\nis our members launching new products\n\nor bringing in new products.\n\nAnd sometimes they get amazing results\n\nand sometimes they're disappointed\n\nwith the results.\n\nAnd it's pretty common topic.\n\nI also see it in our Roadmap to 50k group,\n\nin our free group.\n\nAnd what I think is that,\n\nfor the most part is\nsomething you can control.\n\nIt's in your control.\n\nAnd so, (chuckles) I am working on that\n\nwith my business now.\n\nSo it looks like you can all see me,\n\nI can see Tina from Florida, nice.\n\nAnd somebody from Kansas, California,\n\noh everybody, somebody from the UK, wow.\n\nSo listen, I want to share\nwith you what I am doing\n\nto help control the results of my launch.\n\nBecause here's what's happening.\n\nand these are all things\nthat you can do to.\n\nI have a new product coming.\n\nI'm hoping that I will be talking\n\nabout selling it within a month.\n\nI'm hoping that if it doesn't\nget shipped next week,\n\nit gets shipped to us the week after\n\nand it's 6000 units,\n6000 plus pair of socks.\n\nAnd so it's a more socks\nthan I've ever ordered.\n\nAnd it's interesting\n\nbecause we have four new breeds of socks.\n\nSo four new products that\n\nare for different breeds of socks.\n\nAnd we have one new product\n\nlike box of socks, plus a single sock\n\nthat are for people that like dashon,\n\nso for that doxie audience.\n\nSo the news is that the facts of it all\n\nare that we have one product of these five\n\nthat we already have an audience for, yay.\n\nAnd that's the one product\n\nthat we're doing an amazing collaboration\n\nwith another like a kind of a leader\n\nin the doxy business,\n\nand we're we're doing a\ncollaboration with them.\n\nAnd so I feel very confident\n\nthat we're going to do\nwell with those socks,\n\nbut I don't feel the same confidence\n\nwith all the other, the four other breeds\n\nthat we're doing,\n\nwe have to build the audience for that.\n\nAnd so we have done some\nwork in Facebook groups\n\nto start building awareness\n\nof these products and more on that later.\n\nBut here's what I'm doing right now\n\nkind of broke it down into five steps\n\nof what I am doing right now\n\non our Facebook page\n\nto show you how I'm\nstarting to build awareness\n\nand starting to build an audience\n\nfor these few brands.\n\nAnd so if you have\nquestions as I go through,\n\nI'm going to try and walk you through it.\n\nI'm trying to keep these videos short,\n\nlike 10 minutes,\n\nso I don't bore you all to death.\n\nBut I want to show you how I've done it.\n\nI'm really just at this stage trying\n\nto find people who will potentially\n\nbe interested in my product.\n\nSo I'm going to share my screen,\n\nshow you what I'm doing.\n\nReady.\n\nHey Wes, I see you there.\n\nSo I want to share with you,\n\nI think this one first.\n\nNo, of course not, okay.\n\nThe stream yard sharing is the hardest.\n\nSo what I did guys, first of all\n\nis I posted raw images,\n\nlike really raw behind the scenes images\n\nof the sock samples,\n\nas they, as I was getting\nimages myself for them.\n\nSo these are I don't have these socks.\n\nI just got images from the factory.\n\nAnd so you can see, it's ugly,\n\nthese posts are ugly.\n\nAnd this post actually\nthat I'm sharing with you\n\nis the worst performing\npost of all the posts I did.\n\nBut for each of the four breeds,\n\nI've actually created a post,\n\none post with a simple question.\n\nAnd it's really\ninteresting because I have,\n\nI used kind of different\nquestions on the posts,\n\nand some of them got a much\nbetter response than others.\n\nAnd so what I did with these posts then\n\nis I asked a simple\nquestion with all of them.\n\nAnd I then turned the\npost into an engagement ad\n\nwith a very low budget.\n\nSo I spent $3 a day on\neach of these posts,\n\nand I want to share with you my results.\n\nAnd what's really interesting\nis the results from the ad\n\nare not the same as the\nresults from the post.\n\nSo you can see in this particular post,\n\nwe have 159 engagements.\n\nNow, I want to talk to you about that,\n\nbecause I feel really\nstrongly that a little bit\n\nof money on an ad gets\nyou a lot of free results\n\nas well as the advertising results.\n\nSo I'm going to share\nthat with you right now.\n\nSo let's just hop into my ads manager\n\nand need to show you,\n\nthere we go.\n\nSo you can see, these are\nthe four engagement ads.\n\nAnd so I actually targeted them\n\nto very broad target.\n\nSo what I did is I made a\nlook alike audience of people\n\nwho have visited my website\nand then I just added\n\nin the broad breed audience to that.\n\nSo trying to find people\nwho usually click through\n\nand with a look alike audience\n\nand then adding the interest.\n\nSo for example, Corgi or Goldendoodle,\n\nor Golden retriever,\n\nand I just spent $3 a\nday on an engagement ad,\n\nwhich is really just looking for people\n\nto like, share and comment, that's it.\n\nAnd so I set this up about,\n\nI think about a week ago,\n\nas soon as I was getting the pictures in\n\nI would jump in and set up the ad\n\nand so you can see we have,\n\nwhat 700 and some reactions, 12 comments.\n\nNow I have way more than 12 comments,\n\nbut 12 comments that\nwere related to the add.\n\nSeven posts saves,\n\nwhich is encouraging and 14 shares.\n\nAnd so I'm not going\nto get sales from this.\n\nBut I'm going to show you a little trick\n\nat the end of this video,\n\nabout what I have done\nto get make it pay off\n\nfor me down the road.\n\nSo those are the ads I've set up.\n\nI'm going to let them\nrun until I transition\n\ninto my next thing,\n\nwhich I'll talk about next\nweek, what my next thing is.\n\nBut I just set up these\nreally, crappy photos,\n\nwhich people seem to like on my site.\n\nSo step one, post the photos.\n\nStep two, turn them into engagement ads.\n\nStep three, is to go back\n\nto those posts\n\nand make sure that you\n\ninvite people to like them.\n\nSo I want to show you this,\n\nso here is,\n\nwell that's not the right one again gosh.\n\nI wish I could get this right.\n\nTry that again.\n\nOkay, here we go.\n\nSo this one is,\n\nas I say the worst performing ad so far\n\nbut what I have is\nhundred and eight people\n\nwho have reacted to it.\n\nSo I want you to make sure\nthat when you do this,\n\nyou go ahead and click on those reactions\n\nand you make sure that\nyou invite these people\n\nto like your page.\n\nBecause it is a really,\nreally affordable way\n\nto grow your page.\n\nYou don't really have to spend money\n\non the like ad, when you are doing this.\n\nAnd people are not liking pages anymore\n\nfrom the newsfeed.\n\nAnd really it's kind of a vanity metric.\n\nBut where it's important is\n\nwhen you set up an audience of people\n\nwho have engaged with your Facebook page,\n\nthat's when you can capture these people.\n\nSo it's still totally worth doing.\n\nNow, the other thing that's interesting\n\nis you saw,\n\nI think I had 90 engagements on my ad,\n\nbut I actually have 159\nengagements here on the page.\n\nAnd my feeling is, is that when we pay\n\nwhen we actually pay\nto shoot this thing out\n\nin the newsfeed and people\nstart engaging with it,\n\nFacebook sees that as\na valuable interaction,\n\nand you actually get more organic reach\n\non your post.\n\nAnd so I feel like it's\ntotally worth doing\n\nwhen you're at this stage,\n\nas long as you manage your expectations.\n\nSo I post them, I turn\nthem into engagement ads,\n\nI invite them to like\n\nand then the next thing we did\n\nis we set up not great pictures,\n\nbut we set up these products on our site,\n\neven though we don't have them.\n\nAnd so I'm going to show\nyou what that looks like.\n\nYou're not going to be impressed,\n\nit's not beautiful.\n\nBut I'm going to show you how we did this\n\nand I'm going to tell you why we did it\n\nbecause I feel like it's important.\n\nSo I want the playful, here we go.\n\nSo here we are, ain't that lovely.(laughs)\n\nSo that is what we set up on our site.\n\nWe have a lot of thumbnails\nhere, you can see\n\nof the ugly pictures,\n\nof the real thing.\n\nWe have the box even here,\n\nbut here's what's important to that,\n\nwe set up these samples on the site\n\nand then we also set it up,\n\nnow we use Klaviyo but\nyou there are lots of apps\n\nthat you can use, if\nyou don't have Klaviyo.\n\nBut we set this button up\n\nthat says, \"notify me when available.\"\n\nAnd so what happens when you click that\n\nis you just fill in your email\n\nand you go into a session in Klaviyo,\n\nthat as soon as you\nmake that product live,\n\nit's going to send out an email\nto all those people saying,\n\n\"this product that you wanted is here.\"\n\nAnd so it's a great way to\nset yourself up for sales.\n\nAnd so that's step four,\n\nwe set these samples\npictures up on our website.\n\nWe haven't driven traffic to it yet,\n\nbut we did set up back in stock.\n\nAnd then here is the little trick\n\nthat I did,\n\nwhich I don't know how\neffective it will be.\n\nI'll show you what's\nhappened with the one,\n\nis on I think on Wednesday,\n\nI went back and edited\nthose engagement ads.\n\nAnd so when I first created those posts,\n\nI did not put a link to these products\n\nthat we set up on our site.\n\nAnd then on Wednesday, I went\nback and edited those ads.\n\nAnd the way you do that\nis you actually have\n\nto go remove the post from the ad,\n\njust dump in something temporarily,\n\ngo back edit the post on your page,\n\nand then go back into your ads manager\n\nand put the post back in.\n\nAnd I really did it as\na fishing expedition\n\nto see how many people would click through\n\nto the on an engagement\nad would click through\n\nto the product and see if I could bump up\n\nand kind of hedge my bets\nfor the backend stock.\n\nI get more people on the list.\n\nAnd it was relatively successful,\n\nbut more successful with the\nproduct that I already have\n\nthe audience for.\n\nSo it was the most successful\nfor the being goods one\n\nand I believe, do I have that?\n\nI think I might have it on my screen.\n\nOh no, I don't have it on my screen.\n\nBut what happened, what\nhas happened since I did\n\nthat just so just you know,\n\nwas I have 39 people on my back in stock.\n\nAnd of the 39 people\n\nthat are are waiting for a notification,\n\nI have 27 of them,\n\nare for the socks that I\nalready have the audience for.\n\nBut I still have 12 people\nfrom my engagement ad\n\nthat are waiting for the other breeds.\n\nAnd so I feel like that's\na really great result\n\nfor a simple $3 a day spend.\n\nAnd it's something that\nany one of us could do.\n\nIt's not going to, as long as\nyou manage your expectations,\n\nthis is just for awareness.\n\nIt's starting to build\na big pile of people\n\nthat will be interested in what you have,\n\nand your pixel isn't catching them\n\nunless they go to your site.\n\nBut if you use an audience of people\n\nwho have engaged with Facebook,\n\nor if you're doing this on Instagram,\n\nhave engaged with Instagram,\n\nthen you're going to\ncatch those people again\n\nwhen you go to the next step.\n\nSo for me, the next step\nis the perfect giveaway,\n\nwhich we will be talking about.\n\nAnd that's where I'm going\nto get more people on my list\n\nso that when I have those\nsocks ready to sell,\n\nI have segmented audiences\nof people who want,\n\nwho are very interested in those products.\n\nSo right now I'm starting\nwith 39 people.(laughs)\n\nBut I hope that by the time I'm talking\n\nto you next week,\n\nI have a lot more people.\n\nI'm just going to check,\n\nLisa, you're saying that your ads,\n\nyour ads don't get you results.\n\nAnd so I think that the problem with that,\n\nfirst of all,\n\nI think that running ads\nfor e commerce stores\n\nis very, very different than running ads,\n\nfor coaching and training.\n\nAnd most of what you see,\n\nmost of the people who sell courses,\n\nor give a training on ads\nare training people who\n\nare like bloggers or people\nwho want to sell training\n\nand the strategy is very, very different,\n\nI guarantee you.\n\nSo that's the number one thing\n\nis that the strategy you're\nusing might not be right.\n\nI mean, anyone who's in our\nInner Circle will tell you\n\nthat they have there's a very clear format\n\nof what we use.\n\nBut the second thing I want to say to you\n\nis manage your expectations,\n\nabout what it is that you hope to gain.\n\nI never want to be one of those people\n\nthat depends on ads to get sales\n\nbecause I don't control Facebook,\n\nI don't control Instagram,\n\nI don't control Google.\n\nAnd so if I count on those\nplatforms to get me sales,\n\neverything could be a change.\n\nAnd I have no control\n\nand no way to get it\nback to the way it was.\n\nAnd we've seen it happen\nso many times with people.\n\nAnd so I look at Facebook\nads or Instagram ads,\n\nor even Google Ads\n\nas a way to build an audience of people\n\nwho might be interested in my product.\n\nAnd my next step is almost always\n\nto get them on a list,\n\nso that I can reach\nout to them at any time\n\nand it doesn't cost me anything.\n\nSo I feel like if you can kind\nof manage your expectations\n\nabout what it is you hope to help happen.\n\nWhat you see as success with your ads,\n\nit's all going to be a lot better.\n\nAnd we teach this in the Inner Circle.\n\nIt's actually the same with e commerce.\n\nWhen people are just starting out with,\n\ntheir e commerce business,\n\nthey often think that success is sales\n\nand when you don't have a lot of traffic,\n\nand when I'm saying a lot,\n\nit's actually not a lot in ecom standards,\n\nbut it's basically 100 people a day,\n\nwhen you don't have traffic\nsales or sales are impossible.\n\nAnd so really success at early stages\n\nfor e commerce is traffic,\n\nthat success and so you\nshould be celebrating\n\nwhen you're able to drive\ntraffic, it's so hard.\n\nAnd so many people will\npost crazy screenshots\n\nor some big story and\nthat makes us feel bad\n\nabout what we're doing.\n\nBut the real, the real truth\nof this is that it's a process.\n\nIt's totally a process.\n\nSo listen, I can't see\nall the comments today.\n\nIsn't that wonderful?\n\nSo I will circle back,\n\nleave your questions if you have them.\n\nIf you're not following\nus on the, Roadmap to 50K,\n\nwe send out an update every week\n\nso you can see what we're\nworking on right now.\n\nKind of give you the details\n\nso that you can take those\nstrategies and use them to,\n\nbut we'll put a link here in the comments.\n\nIf you're not following\nus get on that email list\n\nand you'll be able to see\nwhat we do step by step.\n\nSo that's all I got.\n\nI'll see you guys later.\n\nI hope you have a lovely weekend\n\nand let's hope you sell lots.\n\nWe'll see you soon."}],"hls_enabled":true,"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"58bcbc","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"language":"","onByDefault":"true","on":"true","async":"false"}},"vulcan":"true","videoQuality":"","playsinline":true}},"options":{}};
